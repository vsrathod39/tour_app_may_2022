## Lessons Learned

While working on this project, I got to know about state management using redux while developing react app. I learned about React functionality and MDB components.I also got to know about Backend developmentÂ with helpÂ ofÂ Node.js, express.js, JWT, and other NPM packages.

#### Challenges faced: 

I found managing states in react is really difficult. I filled tricky in configuring and using middlewares while developing the backend (server).
